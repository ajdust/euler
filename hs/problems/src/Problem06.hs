Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum.

This problem can be solved with brute force easily, but it is better to use the formulas.
Formula for sum of squares:    1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 ... + n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
Formula for square of the sum: (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)^2   = (n(n+1)/2)^2
