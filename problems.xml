		A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

		As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant
		numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two

		Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

		1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
		8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
		9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4

		As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.

		The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

		Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

		In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

		1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

		It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

		1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

		How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

	<title>Pandigital Products</title>
	<summary>
		We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

		The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

		Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
		HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

	<title>Unorthodox Fractions</title>
	<summary>
		The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to
		simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling
		the 9s.

		We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

		There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and
		containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

		If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the
		denominator.

	<title>Circular primes</title>

		The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

	<title>Truncatable Primes</title>

		The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7.  Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

		Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

		NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

	<title>Pandigital Concatenated</title>
	<summary>
		Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

		192 × 1 = 192
		192 × 2 = 384
		192 × 3 = 576

		By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

		The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

		What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?
